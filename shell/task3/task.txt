Create a script sum.sh which gets a filename as a parameter! 
The file contains many numbers spearated by spaces.  
We don't know the amount of numbers in the lines, 
and we don't know how many lines we have in the file. The script should write
out the numbers separated by + characters and an = character at the end, 
and of course the sum of the line.

Example:

3 4
678 13
1 2
8 9 8
4
Result
3+4=7
678+13=691
1+2=3
8+9+8=25
4=4
